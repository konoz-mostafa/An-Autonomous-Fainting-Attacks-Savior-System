# An-Autonomous-Fainting-Attacks-Savior-System
A front-end An Autonomous Fainting Attacks Savior System built with React 
Design an autonomous system that utilises a bracelet sensor to monitor the heart rate and blood pressure of old people:
- The bracelet sensor should detect heart rate and blood pressure anomalies.
- If the sensor suspects a problem with the patient's heart rate, it should notify his/her relatives by phone and send 
them the patient's location.
- The system should report the ambulance with the patient's case and send them the location.
